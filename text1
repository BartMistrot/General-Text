Here's a version closer to the first rewrite, but slightly less formal:
Subject: Meeting Request: Epic to Paragon Demographics Data Transfer Issue (SD Ticket #89014)
Hello colleagues,
I hope you're all doing well. I'm reaching out regarding an important issue that has recently come to our attention.
Jennifer Ray submitted a ticket to the Revenue Cycle department on May 28th (SD #89014) concerning specific types of demographic information not transferring correctly from Epic to Paragon after updates. Our initial testing has confirmed that there indeed appears to be a problem with data propagation between the two systems.
Given the importance of maintaining accurate patient demographics across our platforms, we believe this issue needs our attention. After discussing with other members of the Revenue Cycle and Applications teams, we'd like to set up a meeting to discuss and troubleshoot the cause of this data transfer problem.
Would you be available to meet in the near future to address this matter? Your expertise would be greatly appreciated in helping us resolve this issue efficiently.
Please let me know your availability, and I'll work on finding a time that suits everyone.
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Looking forward to working together on this.
