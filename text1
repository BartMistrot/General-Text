Subject: Comprehensive System Alert Deployments for Revenue Cycle Team - Urgent Implementation Required

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide an exhaustive overview of the critical system alerts and preventative measures urgently required for our Revenue Cycle Team's deployments. These implementations are needed in the near term to ensure the continuous and efficient operation of our key systems. Please find below a detailed breakdown of each alert, the associated issues, and the proposed preventative actions.

1. System Alert Reference: Job Stream Failed Run Alert

Issue:
The "JobStream" application, an extremely important component of the Paragon Suite, is responsible for daily claims processing at various times throughout the day. This process is critical for preparing claims and other essential financial data for the workforce to process the following day. The significance of this system cannot be overstated â€“ if these jobs fail, money does not come into the organization, resulting in an extremely serious issue.

Specific problems include:
- Certain jobs may hang up and run for extended periods, necessitating re-runs.
- Some jobs may outright fail to run.

Ideal Preventative Action:
Implementation of a sophisticated monitoring system utilizing specific SQL queries to:

a) Check active jobs at predetermined intervals when jobs should NOT be running.
b) Send immediate alerts to the service desk if jobs are still pending or running beyond established thresholds.
c) Query the Paragon's JobStream database entry, which holds information on active running jobs, completed jobs, and other relevant data.
d) Alert if the SQL query detects:
   - Jobs still running beyond the expected timeframe
   - Failed jobs
   - Job queue dates exceeding predetermined thresholds

Key Considerations:
- Careful selection of monitoring intervals and thresholds is crucial, as some jobs may take longer on certain days and nights than others.
- Establish specific times when we can be certain all jobs should be completed.
- The checks should be conducted through SQL queries to the Paragon's JobStream database entry.

2. System Alert Reference: One Content & DEX Alert

Issue:
The DEX service exhibits unpredictable hanging behavior after a variable and unpredictable amount of time. While the service status may report as "running," the actual file processing functionality ceases, necessitating a service restart.

Ideal Preventative Action:
Development of a sophisticated monitoring logic to assess two critical metrics:

a) Current DEX file count in the processing queue:
   - Implement SQL query to retrieve real-time file count from the holding area where files wait to be processed.
b) Last successful file processing timestamp:
   - Execute SQL query to verify the most recent date and time of successful file processing by DEX.

Alert Triggering Logic:
- Option 1: Utilize both metrics with carefully calibrated thresholds to account for normal activity spikes.
- Option 2: Focus solely on the last file processing timestamp if deemed more reliable.

Response Mechanism:
- Automatic corrective action initiation (e.g., service restart)
- Alert dispatch to service desk through the local SMTP relay, resulting in ticket creation in the service desk (SD) system

Additional Notes:
- A threshold for the file count must be properly chosen to avoid alerts during daily bursts of activity.
- The file count metric could potentially be ignored if the logic chosen decides to focus only on the last file date and time processed.

3. System Alert Reference: One Content Upload Alert

Issue:
The One Content upload service experiences unpredictable failures, requiring periodic restarts at various times. Service disruptions can rapidly lead to significant document processing backlogs. A large backload will quickly build up if documents can't be processed by the upload service. The service will report as "running" when it is not actually processing documents.

Ideal Preventative Action:
Implementation of a comprehensive file count monitoring system:

a) Monitor file count across 10-15 specific folder locations.
b) Establish dynamic thresholds to differentiate between normal high-volume periods and genuine service failures.
c) Trigger service desk alerts or initiate corrective actions (e.g., service restart) when file count exceeds the predetermined threshold.

Key Considerations:
- Conduct thorough analysis of historical file count data to determine accurate and adaptive thresholds.
- Implement safeguards to prevent false alarms during predictable high-volume periods or large bursts on busy days.
- The file count would need to be carefully analyzed to understand the appropriate threshold that distinguishes between normal operations and actual service hang-ups.

Next Steps:
1. Review and approve the proposed preventative actions for each system alert.
2. Assign responsible team members for the development and implementation of each monitoring solution.
3. Establish a timeline for the phased deployment of these alerting mechanisms.
4. Schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss any questions or concerns regarding the proposed solutions.
5. Determine the exact SQL queries and logic required for each monitoring system.
6. Identify and allocate the necessary resources for implementation and ongoing maintenance of these alert systems.

Given the critical nature of these systems and their direct impact on our organization's financial operations, I cannot stress enough the importance of swift action on these matters. Please let me know if you require any additional information, clarification, or if you would like to discuss any aspect of these proposed solutions in greater detail.

I look forward to your feedback and guidance on how to proceed with these critical improvements to our system monitoring capabilities.
