Hey Ellie,

  This is just a time for us to discuss what applications I’ll need permissions for and to see what the other developers generally have access to for development and I can verify if I’ll need that as well. It might take a little bit of time to go through their permissions and verify everything I need and don’t require. 

Then I can write the official email listing everything and CC Garret and Cody requesting access from you directly so you will have an official request for this and no one gets into any trouble as I have already generally discussed this with both Cody and Garret.
