Here's a more business casual version of the email:

Subject: Quick Chat: Setting Up My Dev Access

Hi Ellie,

Hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base about setting up my application permissions as a new developer. I was thinking we could have a quick sit-down to go over:

- What apps and systems the other devs typically have access to
- Which of those I'll need for my work
- Any special access I might require for my specific tasks

It might take a bit to go through everything, but I think it'll be worth it to make sure we cover all the bases.

After we chat, I'll put together an official email with the full list of what I need, and I'll CC Garrett and Cody on it. That way, you'll have a formal request on record, and we'll keep everything above board. I've already given Cody and Garrett a heads up about this, so they're in the loop.

Let me know when you've got some time to meet up and go through this. Thanks for your help in getting me set up!

Best,
[Your Name]
