Good Afternoon,

    Recently a ticket was sent to revenue cycle by Jennifer Ray regarding specific types of demographics information not making its way to Paragon when updated in Epic. The ticket has been open since May 28th after doing some initial testing there does indeed seem to be an issue with data propagating to Paragon after changes have been made in Epic. 

    After discussing this issue with other members on the revenue cycle/applications team we wanted to reach out and see if we could set up a time to discuss and troubleshoot what might be causing this issue.
