       Hey Garret, 

   I wanted to give you a heads up that I am still working with Ellie in ACG on getting the proper permissions setup and others to get the proper software installed such as Visual Studio. Until I get these items sorted out, I won’t be able to report on anything at the weekly meeting. I wanted to ask would you prefer me still shadow the meeting or sit out until I’m actively able to work on revenue cycle projects?
