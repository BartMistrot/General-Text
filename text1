Subject: Quick Update on My Setup Progress

Hi Garrett,

I wanted to touch base about my current situation. I'm still working with Ellie in ACG to get my permissions sorted out and the right software (like Visual Studio) installed. 

Since I'm not up and running yet, I won't have anything to report at our weekly meetings for a bit. I was wondering - would you prefer I still sit in on these meetings to stay in the loop, or should I hold off until I'm able to actively work on the revenue cycle projects?

Let me know what you think works best.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
