Please place an edit on the Aetna Better Health claims F86 to flag the biller if there is no CPT/HCPCS on the claim according to the attached requirement from Aetna Better Health.   Thanks. 

Hey [Coworker’s Name],

I just wrote a new bridge routine for our Aetna Better Health claims and wanted to run it by you before we put it live. Basically, Aetna has this new rule where certain revenue codes have to have a CPT or HCPCS code, otherwise the claim could get denied or they might take back the payment later.

What I did was set up the routine to first filter out only the Aetna claims. Then it checks if the claim has any of those specific revenue codes that Aetna cares about. If it finds one without a corresponding CPT/HCPCS code, it flags the claim with an error. This way, the biller gets a heads-up to fix it before the claim goes out.

Can you take a quick look and let me know if I missed anything? Just want to make sure everything’s covered.

Thanks!

ADVICE:

Replace

/SELECT=LOB(AETNA)

with 

/SELECT=COMPARE(TP_PLAN[ACTIVE],EQ,F86,3)  



Create a Bank for the Rev Codes, you can name the bank whatever you want, I would recommend having the Payor Name or Plan Code in the name since this bank is specific to this request.  Note how we have ranges in the bank.  The bank has to appear above the line that calls it.  

/BANK=BARTS_RCODES 
360-362,367,369,450,480,481,482,490,499,750,759,761,790,810-815,819

Then you can remove all of the /SET lines except the first one.  

Modify that one line to be 
/SET_OCC=ALL(SL_RCODE,INBANK, BARTS_RCODES,3, SL_HCPCS,EQ,BLANK,0)

When you use EQ or NE BLANK you have to assign it a length of zero.  
Why did I change the /SET_OCC=ANY to /SET_OCC=ALL

Remove the OMIT statement – OMIT actually omits the entire claim from the routine if the result is true.

Amanda,

For Dr. Udoh he has required special access priveledges in the past no other physician here has currently required before which means that he would require a special new role created for physicians that may fall into his situation in the future. Our secuirty policies here dictate that we cannot issue user specific access and everything has to be done via role based assignments and currently no other physician has required the access permissions for everything dr. udoh currently has required. This includes the prior sepsis patient queue previously created as that would need to be updated into his new role that would be created for physicians in a similar role.

In order for me to properly assist dr. udoh and you with these requests we would need an official justification written up for what his role is, why he needs these permissions, what facilities he is regularly working in, a list of his roles and permissions required to perform his job without inhibiting any of his duties, and any other important information you may feel is necessary for his special circumstance. 

Once our team has this information we can send it to our access control group and have a new physician role created for physicians that fall under his specific circumstances. As it currently stands in order for dr udoh to get access to every and any file type we would have to give all physicians access to them and that would violate our security policies for the "least privilidge" priciple which keeps our organization safe.
