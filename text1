Subject: Critical System Alerts and Preventative Measures for Revenue Cycle Team

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide a comprehensive overview of the critical system alerts and preventative measures required for our Revenue Cycle Team's deployments in the near term. Please find below a detailed breakdown of each alert, the associated issues, and the proposed preventative actions.

1. System Alert Reference: Job Stream Failed Run Alert

Issue:
The "JobStream" application, a crucial component of the Paragon Suite, is responsible for daily claims processing and preparation of essential financial data for the workforce. Failure in these jobs results in significant financial implications for our organization. Specific jobs may experience prolonged execution times, necessitating re-runs, or fail to initiate altogether.

Ideal Preventative Action:
Implementation of a robust monitoring system utilizing specific SQL queries to:

a) Check active jobs at predetermined intervals when jobs should not be running.
b) Send alerts to the service desk if jobs are still pending or running beyond established thresholds.
c) Query the Paragon's JobStream database to monitor active running jobs, completed jobs, and other relevant metrics.
d) Alert if the SQL query detects:
   - Jobs still running beyond the expected timeframe
   - Failed jobs
   - Job queue dates exceeding predetermined thresholds

Key Considerations:
- Careful selection of monitoring intervals to account for normal variations in job execution times.
- Establishment of accurate thresholds to minimize false positives while ensuring timely detection of genuine issues.

2. System Alert Reference: One Content & DEX Alert

Issue:
The DEX service exhibits intermittent and unpredictable hanging behavior. While the service status may report as "running," the actual file processing functionality ceases, necessitating a service restart.

Ideal Preventative Action:
Development of a sophisticated monitoring logic to assess two critical metrics:

a) Current DEX file count in the processing queue:
   - Implement SQL query to retrieve real-time file count from the holding area.
b) Last successful file processing timestamp:
   - Execute SQL query to verify the most recent date and time of successful file processing by DEX.

Alert Triggering Logic:
- Option 1: Utilize both metrics with carefully calibrated thresholds to account for normal activity spikes.
- Option 2: Focus solely on the last file processing timestamp if deemed more reliable.

Response Mechanism:
- Automatic corrective action initiation (e.g., service restart)
- Alert dispatch to service desk via local SMTP relay, resulting in ticket creation

3. System Alert Reference: One Content Upload Alert

Issue:
The One Content upload service experiences unpredictable failures, requiring periodic restarts. Service disruptions can rapidly lead to significant document processing backlogs, despite the service status reporting as "running."

Ideal Preventative Action:
Implementation of a comprehensive file count monitoring system:

a) Monitor file counts across 10-15 designated folder locations.
b) Establish dynamic thresholds to differentiate between normal high-volume periods and genuine service failures.
c) Trigger service desk alerts or initiate corrective actions (e.g., service restart) when file count exceeds the predetermined threshold.

Key Considerations:
- Conduct thorough analysis of historical file count data to determine accurate and adaptive thresholds.
- Implement safeguards to prevent false alarms during predictable high-volume periods.

Next Steps:
1. Review and approve the proposed preventative actions for each system alert.
2. Assign responsible team members for the development and implementation of each monitoring solution.
3. Establish a timeline for the phased deployment of these alerting mechanisms.
4. Schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss any questions or concerns regarding the proposed solutions.

Please let me know if you require any additional information or clarification on any of the points discussed above. I look forward to your feedback and guidance on how to proceed with these critical improvements to our system monitoring capabilities.
