Amanda,
I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing regarding the special access privileges required for Dr. Udoh. To address this situation comprehensively and in compliance with our security policies, we need to take the following steps:

Current Situation:

Dr. Udoh requires access privileges beyond those currently assigned to other physicians.
Our security policies mandate role-based access assignments rather than user-specific access.
A new role needs to be created to accommodate Dr. Udoh's requirements and similar future cases.


Required Information:
To proceed with creating this new role, we need an official justification including:

A detailed description of Dr. Udoh's role
Rationale for the required permissions
List of facilities where Dr. Udoh regularly works
Comprehensive list of roles and permissions necessary for Dr. Udoh to perform his duties without hindrance
Any additional relevant information pertaining to his special circumstances


Next Steps:

Once we receive this information, our team will forward it to the Access Control Group.
The Access Control Group will then create a new physician role to accommodate these specific circumstances.


Current Limitations:

Granting Dr. Udoh access to all file types would require extending the same access to all physicians.
This blanket approach would violate our "least privilege" security principle.


Additional Considerations:

The new role will need to incorporate access to the previously created sepsis patient queue.



We appreciate your assistance in gathering this information. It is crucial for maintaining our security standards while ensuring Dr. Udoh can perform his duties effectively.
Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
